- **Computer vision**: Object detection and path planning
- **GPS integration**: Long-range navigation and positioning
- **Obstacle avoidance**: Dynamic path adjustment

### Power Systems
- **Solar panel array**: 100W flexible panels
- **Battery management**: LiFePO4 battery pack with smart charging
- **Power optimization**: Intelligent sleep/wake cycles

### Sensor Suite
- **LIDAR scanner**: 360-degree environmental sensing
- **RGB cameras**: Stereo vision setup for depth perception
- **IMU**: 9-axis motion tracking
- **Environmental sensors**: Temperature, humidity, UV index

## Technical Implementation

The rover runs on ROS (Robot Operating System) with custom Python nodes for:
- Sensor fusion and state estimation
- Path planning and navigation
- Power management
- Remote monitoring and control

## Performance Results

- **Operational time**: 8+ hours continuous operation
- **Navigation accuracy**: Sub-meter positioning
- **Obstacle detection**: 95% success rate in varied terrain
- **Power efficiency**: Maintained operation through 3-day field test

## Challenges Overcome
