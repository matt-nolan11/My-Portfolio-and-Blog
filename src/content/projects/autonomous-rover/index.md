# Autonomous Rover Project

An exploration into autonomous outdoor robotics, featuring solar power, computer vision, and advanced navigation systems.

## Project Overview

This rover was designed to operate independently in outdoor environments for extended periods, using solar power and intelligent navigation to explore and map terrain.

## Key Features

### Autonomous Navigation
- **LIDAR-based mapping**: Real-time environment mapping
- **Computer vision**: Object detection and path planning
- **GPS integration**: Long-range navigation and positioning
- **Obstacle avoidance**: Dynamic path adjustment

### Power Systems
- **Solar panel array**: 100W flexible panels
- **Battery management**: LiFePO4 battery pack with smart charging
- **Power optimization**: Intelligent sleep/wake cycles

### Sensor Suite
- **LIDAR scanner**: 360-degree environmental sensing
- **RGB cameras**: Stereo vision setup for depth perception
- **IMU**: 9-axis motion tracking
- **Environmental sensors**: Temperature, humidity, UV index

## Technical Implementation

The rover runs on ROS (Robot Operating System) with custom Python nodes for:
- Sensor fusion and state estimation
- Path planning and navigation
- Power management
- Remote monitoring and control

## Performance Results

- **Operational time**: 8+ hours continuous operation
- **Navigation accuracy**: Sub-meter positioning
- **Obstacle detection**: 95% success rate in varied terrain
- **Power efficiency**: Maintained operation through 3-day field test

## Challenges Overcome

- **Weather resistance**: Sealed electronics and water-resistant design
- **Power optimization**: Balancing performance with energy consumption
- **Terrain handling**: Robust suspension and traction systems
- **Communication**: Long-range telemetry in remote areas

This project demonstrated the viability of long-term autonomous operation in challenging outdoor environments and served as a foundation for further research into planetary exploration robotics.
