# 6-DOF Robot Arm v1

This project involved designing and building a 6-degree-of-freedom robot arm from scratch, including mechanical design, electronics integration, and software control systems.

## Project Overview

The goal was to create a versatile robotic arm capable of precise positioning and movement in 3D space. The arm features six servo-controlled joints providing full spatial manipulation capabilities.

## Mechanical Design

### Frame Construction
- **Material**: 3D printed PLA components with aluminum reinforcement
- **Joints**: High-torque servo motors (MG996R) for primary joints
- **End Effector**: Custom gripper with force feedback
- **Weight**: Approximately 2.5 kg total assembly

### Design Considerations
- Optimized for reach vs. payload balance
- Modular joint design for easy maintenance
- Cable management integrated into frame structure

## Electronics & Control

### Hardware
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino Mega 2560
- **Servo Driver**: PCA9685 16-channel PWM driver
- **Power Supply**: 12V/5A switching power supply
- **Sensors**: Rotary encoders for position feedback

### Control Software
Developed a custom control system featuring:
- **Inverse Kinematics Solver**: Real-time calculation of joint angles
- **Path Planning**: Smooth trajectory generation
- **Safety Limits**: Joint angle and velocity constraints
- **Serial Interface**: PC communication for high-level commands

```cpp
// Example: Inverse kinematics calculation
void calculateIK(float x, float y, float z, float* jointAngles) {
    // Simplified IK solver for demonstration
    float r = sqrt(x*x + y*y);
    float theta1 = atan2(y, x);
    
    // Additional calculations for remaining joints...
    jointAngles[0] = theta1;
    // ... more joint calculations
}
```

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Servo Precision
**Problem**: Standard servos lacked the precision needed for smooth movement.
**Solution**: Implemented encoder feedback and PID control for improved accuracy.

### Challenge 2: Power Management
**Problem**: High current draw during simultaneous servo movement.
**Solution**: Added capacitor bank and implemented sequential joint movement.

### Challenge 3: Inverse Kinematics Complexity
**Problem**: Real-time IK calculations were computationally intensive.
**Solution**: Optimized algorithms and pre-computed lookup tables for common positions.

## Performance Results

- **Positioning Accuracy**: Â±2mm repeatability
- **Payload Capacity**: 500g at full extension
- **Operating Speed**: 15cm/s maximum end-effector velocity
- **Response Time**: <100ms for simple movements

## Future Improvements

1. **Vision Integration**: Add camera for object recognition and tracking
2. **Force Control**: Implement force sensors for delicate manipulation
3. **Wireless Control**: Replace serial with wireless communication
4. **Machine Learning**: Add learned behaviors for common tasks

## Lessons Learned

This project provided valuable experience in:
- Multi-disciplinary system integration
- Real-time control system design
- Mechanical design for robotics applications
- The importance of thorough testing and iteration

The robot arm serves as a platform for ongoing robotics experiments and has been used in several follow-up projects involving automated assembly tasks.
