# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2025-06-30_

Welcome to Matt Nolan’s personal portfolio and blog. This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) using the open-source [StarGarden](https://github.com/sustanza/stargarden) theme and is focused on robotics, engineering, and making. Your privacy is important, and this page explains what information is (and isn’t) collected when you visit.

---

## 1. Information Collected

- **No Personal Data Collected:**  
  This site does not collect personal information such as names, email addresses, or account details. There are no user accounts, contact forms, or comment sections.

- **No Cookies or Tracking:**  
  This site does not use cookies, analytics, or tracking scripts.

---

## 2. Hosting & Server Logs

- The site is hosted on **GitHub Pages**. GitHub may collect basic, non-personal server logs (such as IP address, browser type, and access times) for security and operational purposes.  
  Please refer to [GitHub's Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) for more details.

## 3. Embedded Content

Some posts may include embedded content (e.g., YouTube videos, GitHub gists). Embedded content from other websites behaves as if you visited those sites directly and may collect data according to their own privacy policies.

## 4. Use of Information

- No personal data is collected, stored, or shared by this site or its owner.
- Any analytics or data collection is solely handled by GitHub Pages or third-party embeds, not by this site.
